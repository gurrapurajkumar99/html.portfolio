<p>In addition to your YouTube endeavors, you are a committed student of computer science and engineering (CSE). This academic background equips you with a deep understanding of the technical aspects that underpin the digital and financial worlds you explore in your content.

Your passion for technology and finance is not just theoretical but is grounded in the rigorous training and knowledge you gain through your CSE program.</p>


<p>Beyond your academic and YouTube commitments, you are also deeply involved in the entrepreneurial ecosystem at your university, serving as the Senior President of the University Startup Club. In this role, you lead initiatives that inspire and support fellow students in their startup ventures, fostering a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship on campus.
